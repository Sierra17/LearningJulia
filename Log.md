# Learning Julia Activity Log

### 16/3:

- Repository Setup
- Documentation https://docs.julialang.org
- Installation of default configuration on local machine
- Started first interactive session with `$julia`
- Created and ran first script.

### 23/3:

- Downloaded some packages
- Made my first plots and realised that plotting things from the command line is not trivial

### 30/3:

- Julia seems to be a language to be interpreted rather than compiled; it is more comfortable to use in a jupyter-like environment
- First use for data science, did some basic regressions with `Pkg DataFrames, GLM, MLBase` following https://www.machinelearningplus.com/linear-regression-in-julia/
